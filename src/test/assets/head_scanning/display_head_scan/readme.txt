These screenshots were captured from ROS and pure Python with the robot in identical spots. Notice that the ROS floor looks full. The ROS one was captured with `stretch_pyfunmap.ros_mapping.ROSHeadScan` with `hm.HelloNode.quick_create` in iPython and `funmap.launch` running in the background. The pyfunmap one was captured with `stretch_pyfunmap.mapping.HeadScan` and `stretch_pyfunmap.robot.FunmapRobot`.
